## Development Setup

The following system dependencies are required:

- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation): manage dependencies and virtual environments
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install): run linters and formatters for the package
  - > [!TIP]
    > `pre-commit` is included as a `dev` dependency; however, it tends to work better when it's installed at the user / system level
- (optional) [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html): automatically execute the [`.envrc`](./.envrc) script to install project dependencies
  - if you don't want to set up `direnv`, you can manually run `. ./.envrc` instead

Common development commands are managed by [`poethepoet`](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet); run `poe --help` for an up-to-date list of commands:

```sh
